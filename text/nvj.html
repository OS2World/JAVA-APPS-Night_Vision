<p><b>Night Vision</b> is a "planetarium" program for computers, and will
display the heavens from any location on earth.  Viewing options allow the
user to control which sky objects to display, which font to use, and
manipulation of various star parameters.  Time may be set to run at
multiple speeds, including backwards.  Color star charts may be printed.

<p>Because this program is written in Java, it can run on any computer
with a recent version of Java installed (includes most computers -
see requirements below).

<h2>Night Vision on the Internet</h2>

<p><b>Night Vision</b> has a home page on the Internet at:

<pre>
    <a href="http://www.nvastro.com/nvj.html">http://www.nvastro.com/nvj.html</a>

<p>Currently you can contact the author at:

<p><!-- This address is heavily SPAM'd, and so it may change in the future.
Check the web page for the latest address. -->It is a good idea to prefix
your Email subject line with [NV], as in
<pre>
    Subject: [NV] Like your program!

so that it is easily distinguishable from SPAM and is less likely to
get inadvertently deleted.

<p><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p><b>Night Vision</b> should run on any computer that contains a recent
Java Runtime Environment (Java 1.5 or later). Most computers sold in
recent years meet this requirement. (In the unlikely event that yours
does not, the Java software can be downloaded
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
online</a>.)

<p><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Starting Night Vision</h2>

<p>If <b>Night Vision</b> is installed by downloading and executing
a self-installing package (i.e. clicking on an install link from a web page),
an icon should be installed on your computer which, depending on the
operating system and install options, is typically accessible through
the start menu.  Clicking on this icon will start the program.

<p>Otherwise if <b>Night Vision</b> is installed by downloading the
manual zip file, extract the files into a directory on your hard drive
and issue the following command from a command window in that directory:

<pre>
    java -jar nvj.jar
</pre>

<p>Java is case sensitive, so type the command exactly as shown.

<p>On some systems (e.g. Windows) users can double click the left mouse
button on the nvj.jar file icon to start the program.

<p><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Your first view</h2>

<p><b>Night Vision</b> opens (when in the default Alt-Az mode)
with a view of the heavens looking straight up (the zenith)
from the user's preferred location.  (Or, until
a preferred location has been selected, a default location of
Niwot, Colorado, a small town where this program started.)

<p>Within the main star window the mouse can be used to
manipulate the view.  Simply click and hold
the left mouse button, then drag it where desired.  (Tip:  It is best
to click on the bottom half of the window when at the zenith
to avoid a rapid change in azimuth.)  To zoom in or out use
the mouse wheel.  Objects can be identified by clicking with the
right mouse button.

<p>Four Scrollbars can be added if desired by clicking "Set"
on the menubar, then "Window..." to bring up the
"Window preferences" window.  The
scrollbars can be used to control the azimuth and altitude
(or right ascension and declination if in RA-Dec mode),
the zoom, and rotation around the center of the window.

<p>Additionally the view can be manipulated via the keyboard, e.g.
pressing 'z' to zoom in, or 'Shift-z' to zoom out.  See
"Keys help" in the online help for further details.

<p>Zooming in can also be accomplished by drawing a rectangle on the screen.
This is done by holding down the 'Shift' key, then pressing the
left mouse button and dragging the mouse.  When the button is released
the center of the rectangle is moved to the center of the window
at a zoom level based on the area of the rectangle.  (Press 'p'
to return to the previous view.)

<p>An entire 180&deg; view can be seen (i.e. 90&deg; in all directions
from the center of the window) by zooming out and/or enlarging the
window.

<p>The toolbar allows for easy manipulation
of viewable items and other program functions.  Hovering the
mouse over each button will trigger a popup that provides a brief
description of its function.

<p>Star charts may be printed by clicking on the toolbar's print
button (or via the "File" pull down menu).

<p><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Setup</h2>

<p><b>Night Vision</b> can be set up for any location on earth.  Begin by going
to the "Set location" window (via the "Set" pull down menu).  Select the
location closest to your location and press "OK Location".  Or enter your
longitude, latitude, and time zone values and press "OK Coordinates".  If your
new location is in a different time zone, then your local time (as displayed in
the information bar above the star window) will have changed, and you must
reset the time.  To do so, go to the "Set local date/time" window (via the
"Time" pull down menu), and then press "Set to computer date/time".  You are
now re-sync'd to your computer time.

<p>Be sure to save this location information if you would like
<b>Night Vision</b> to always start at this position.  Go to the "File"
pull down menu and select "Save location".

<p>You may also save your viewing preferences (objects, fonts, colors, star
parameters, ...) by selecting "Save preferences" from the "File" pull down
menu.

<p>Note:  The location database used in the "Set location" window may be edited
to add new locations.  See "User editable files" in the online help.

<p><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Translating Night Vision</h2>

<p><b>Night Vision</b> has been designed to be readily translable into other
languages.  See the online help for information.

<p><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Misc. notes</h2>

<p>The star database is derived from the "All-Sky Compiled Catalog of
2.5 million stars" (ASCC-2.5, 3rd version, Kharchenko N.V., Roeser S, 2009).
It contains over 1,064,000 stars (through 11th magnitude).

<p>Various sources were used for the algorithms employed by <b>Night Vision</b>.
Among them are <b><i>Practical Astronomy with your Calculator</i></b>
(3rd edition) by Peter Duffett-Smith, and <b><i>Astronomical Algorithms</i></b>
(2nd edition) by Jean Meeus.

<p><hr><!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Future updates</h2>

<p><b>Night Vision</b> may be updated in the future.  Future updates may
include:

<ul>
<li>Telescope interface
<li>User modifiable information bar
<li>Comets
<li>...
</ul>

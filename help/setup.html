<h1>Setting up <b>Night Vision</b></h1>

<p><b>Night Vision</b> can be set up for any location on earth.
Begin by going to the <a href="setloc.html">Set location</a>
window (via the "Set" pull down menu).  Select the location closest to your
location and press "OK Location".
Or enter your longitude, latitude, and time zone values and
press "OK Coordinates".  If your new location is in a
different time zone, then your local time (as displayed in the information
bar above the star window) will have changed, and you must reset the time.
To do so, go to the <a href="datetime.html">Set local date/time</a> window
(via the "Time" pull down menu), and then press "Set to computer date/time".
You are now re-sync'd to your computer time.

<p>Be sure to save this location information if you would like
<b>Night Vision</b> to always start at this position.  Go to the "File"
pull down menu and select "Save location".

<p>You may also save your viewing preferences (objects, fonts, colors,
star parameters, ...) by selecting "Save preferences" from
the "File" pull down menu.

<p>Note:  The location database used in the "Set location" window may be
<a href="useredit.html">edited</a> to add new locations.

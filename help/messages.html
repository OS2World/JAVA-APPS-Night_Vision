<h1>Messages window</h1>

<p>This window displays messages generated by <b>Night Vision</b>.
Generally these are errors found while reading <a href="useredit.html">
user editable</a> files during startup.  For example, if a line in the
deep sky object file, nvdeepsky.txt, has an error, that error will be listed
in this window, hopefully with an explanation sufficient enough to tell
how to correct it.

<p>The Messages window is invoked by selecting "Show messages" from
the "File" pull down menu.  If there are no messages to show, this
selection will grayed out.

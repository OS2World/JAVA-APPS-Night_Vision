<h1>Object identification window</h1>

<p>This window displays information about the object or area
clicked on.

<p>If an object was found, its type and name (if available) are listed.
Also listed are positional coordinates:  right ascension, declination,
azimuth, and altitude (at the time the object was selected).  If this
is not the first identification done, then the angular separation from
the previous identify is listed.

<p>Also displayed are J2000 coordinates, which describes the location
without precession and nutation.  These are the coordinates commonly
seen in star charts.  Precession is the slow wobble the earth's axis
makes (like a gyroscope) over a 25,800 year cycle.  Additionally
there is a small nodding of the axis which is called Nutation.  The
two combined shift the J2000 coordinates into the observed coordinates.

<p>For the Sun and the planets, the distance in astronomical units (AU)
is given.  (1 AU is approximately the mean distance from the Earth to
the Sun.)  For the Moon, the distance in kilometers (KM) is given.  To
convert from AU to KM, multiply by 149,597,870.691.  To convert from
KM to miles, divide by 1.609344.  Also the angular size is given
in seconds for the planets, and in minutes for the Sun and Moon.
(Jupiter and Saturn have noticeable differences between equatorial
and polar diameters due to their rapid rotations.  The larger (equatorial)
size is given.  Multiply Saturn's size by 2.27 to get the width of
its (readily) visible rings.  The size for Venus includes its
thick cloud layer.)  The angular size is also given for most
deep sky objects.

<p>Depending on availability, the (apparent) magnitude is given,
and for stars, their designation (Bayer and/or Flamsteed labels
followed by a 3 letter
<a href="const.html">constellation</a> abbreviation) and
<a href="spectra.html">spectral type</a> are listed.

<br><h3>Corrections applied to coordinate positions</h3>

<p>Although the speed of light is very fast (299,792,458 meters per second),
it is not infinite.  This requires adjustments for the following:

<ul>
<li><i>Effect of light-time</i>:  The sun and planets are positioned
where they were when they emitted or reflected the light that is
currently seen.

<li><i>Effect of aberration</i>:  The motion of the earth around the
sun deflects light in much the same way as a car driving through a
rain storm changes the perceived direction of the rain hitting the
windshield.  (The adjustment for aberration is not applied to
J2000 coordinates.)
</ul>

<p>Additionally the sun, moon, and planets are adjusted to account
for the observer's longitude and latitude.  (This corrects for
<i>diurnal parallax</i> - also called <i>geocentric parallax</i>.)

<p>Some adjustments not done, but may be included in later versions
of <b>Night Vision</b>, are:

<ul>
<li><i>Proper motion</i>:  The apparent motion of a star across the
celestial sphere.  This is at right angles to the observer's line of
sight, as opposed <i>radial motion</i>, which is toward or away from
the observer.

<li><i>Atmospheric refraction</i>:  The bending light caused by
our atmosphere.  It is most pronounced at the horizon, causing
objects to appear higher than they really are.

<li><i>Annual parallax</i>:  The slight shift in the position of
nearer stars when seen from opposite sides of the earth's orbit.
It never exceeds 0.8 arc seconds.

<li><i>Gravitational deflection of light</i>:  The deflection of
light passing close to the sun.
</ul>

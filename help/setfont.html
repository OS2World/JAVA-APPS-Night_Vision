<h1>Set fonts window</h1>

<p>Use this window to set the fonts for the various objects in
the main star window.  These fonts are also used for printing star charts.
(Bayer and Flamsteed star labels use a plain font that has
the same size as that used for star names.)  Select the object in the
top listbox, then modify its font below.  ("Horizon markers" refer
to compass directions along the horizon ("N", "NE", "E", ...).)

<p>Pressing "OK" or "Apply" accepts new values.
<br>Pressing "Cancel" rejects any changes.

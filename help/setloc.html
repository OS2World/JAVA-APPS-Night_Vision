<h1>Set location window</h1>

<p>Use this window to select a location anywhere on earth, either by
selecting a location in the location list box, or by directly entering the
longitude and latitude of the desired location.

<p>The locations shown in the location list box are the locations listed
in the location database file, <b>nvlocations.txt</b>, which is kept
internally within the program unless the user chooses to
<a href="write.html">write</a> it externally.  (This allows
the user to <a href="useredit.html">edit</a> the locations to
their preferences - see directions at the top of <b>nvlocations.txt</b>).
Most of the locations have been configured to know when
daylight saving time (DST) is in effect.  When this is known, the
"Auto DST" checkbox will be enabled and checked (by default).
Most users will not need to change this setting.  To override,
uncheck the "Auto DST" checkbox and then check or uncheck the "DST on"
checkbox to manually set whether DST is in effect.  For locations
that have not been configured to automatically know when DST is
to occur (in the <b>nvlocations.txt</b> file), the "Auto DST" checkbox
will be disabled, and the user must manually set DST.
Once a location and DST have been set, press "OK Location" to go to
the new location.

<p>Alternately the new location can be specified by directly
entering its longitude, latitude, and time zone.
Latitude is entered as 0 to 90 degrees and 0 to 59 minutes,
and selecting north or south.
(Minutes must be 0 if degrees are set to 90.)
Longitude is entered as 0 to 180 degrees and 0 to 59 minutes,
and selecting east or west.
(Minutes must be 0 if degrees are set to 180.)
Time zone is entered as 0 to 13 hours and 0 to 59 minutes,
and selecting + or - (should follow east and west longitudes
respectively).  (Minutes must be 0 if hours are set to 13.)
Time zone represents the (standard) time difference between
the location and Greenwich, England.
Check or uncheck the "DST on" checkbox to manually set whether DST
is in effect.  Once coordinates and DST have been set, press
"OK Coordinates" to go to the new location.

<p>Note:  Changing the location will change the time indicated in the
information bar above the main star window if the new time zone differs from
current time zone.  This allows the user to hop from location to location while
maintaining the same time in the first location.  For example, hopping from
Denver to Dallas changes the time from say 1:00 to 2:00, because
the time in Dallas is 2:00 when the time in Denver is 1:00.

<p>When DST is not automatic, DST can also be manually set via the
"Set local date/time" window.

<p>Press "OK Location" to accept a location from the list box.
<br>
Press "OK Coordinates" to accept a location based on the specified
longitude/latitude coordinates and time zone.
<br>
Pressing "Cancel" rejects any changes.

<p>If desired, use the "Save location" selection from the "File" pull down menu
to save the current location so that <b>Night Vision</b> begins there when
starting.  "Save location" also saves the current DST setting.

<p>Note:  When "Auto DST" is enabled and checked, the transition dates to and
from DST are determined by information within your computer's Java
installation.  Unfortunately this information contains no historical data.
Thus the same transition rules are applied to all years.  For example,
in 2007 the USA changed the rules for the dates when DST starts and ends,
expanding the amount of the year when DST is in effect.  To be accurate,
your Java installation should be updated with the latest DST rules.
However these same rules are also applied to prior years when DST was
determined differently.  Thus for prior years "Auto DST" should be
unset so that DST can be set manually, depending on date.

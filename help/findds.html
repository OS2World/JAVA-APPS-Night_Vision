<h1>Find deep sky object window</h1>

<p>Use this window to find a
<a href="deepsky.html">deep sky object</a> (i.e. galaxy, nebula, ...).

<p>The checkboxes can be selected/deselected to show only objects
of particular types, and the text field can be utilized to look for
a character string (e.g. to list only NGC objects, type in "ngc";
case is unimportant).

<p>Note:  The object may not be visible if it is too dim for current
magnitude settings or if the showing of deep sky objects has been
turned off.

<p>Pressing "OK" or "Apply" locates the selected object.
<br>Pressing "Cancel" dismisses the window.

<h1>Set star parameters window</h1>

<p>Use this window to control how different magnitude stars
are to appear.  Magnitude (a.k.a. apparent magnitude) refers to
how bright a star appears.  This is an inverse relationship:  the
lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. Very bright stars
have magnitudes less than zero.  Dim stars, up to about
magnitude 6, can be seen by most people in dark skies.
Each whole number represents a change in brightness by a factor
of 2.512, which is the 5th root of 100.  Thus 5 whole numbers
represents a change in brightness by 100 times.

<p>The two "Limiting magnitude" sliders control how many stars
are shown by setting the minimum magnitude when completely zoomed-out
and zoomed-in.  By offsetting these two sliders (i.e. keeping
the lower one to the right of the upper one), more stars will
begin to appear while zooming in.
<p>The bottom two sliders control what size dot is used to represent
the brightest and dimmest stars.
The "Dimmest" slider refers to stars having a magnitude calculated
from the top two sliders and the zoom level.
<p>Pressing "OK" or "Apply" accepts new values.
<br>Pressing "Cancel" rejects any changes.

<h1>Solar System window</h1>

<p>This window allows the user to view the solar system from any angle.

<p>Initially the view is from the top looking down onto the plane of
the solar system (where top is above the earth's northern hemisphere).
Dragging the mouse from left to right rotates the solar system
counter-clockwise, which is the direction the planets travel through time.
Dragging the mouse vertically adjusts the tilt of the plane along
a horizontal axis.  Portions of the orbit paths that are closer
than the sun will appear brighter, while those farther will appear
dimmer.

<p>Zooming in or out can be done with the mouse wheel.

<p>Scrollbars can be added via "Options" on the menubar.  
They are particularly handy if only one axis of rotation is desired.

<ul>
<li>The "tilt" scrollbar (right side of window) tilts the solar system along a
horizontal axis (as with dragging the mouse vertically).

<li>The "rotate" scrollbar (bottom of window) rotates the solar system around
the sun in the direction of their travel or the opposite direction,
when moving the scroll to the right or left respectively (as with
dragging the mouse horizontally).  The vernal equinox position of the
earth is to the left of the sun when the scroll is in the center position,
and to the right of the sun when the scroll is either at the far left
or far right position.

<li>The "zoom" scrollbar (left side of window) zooms the view in and out
(as with moving the mouse wheel).
</ul>

<p>Time controls can be added via "Options" on the menubar.  Time controls
provide an easy means to watch how the positions of the planets change by
stepping the time in forward or reverse directions.

<p>The orbital paths are based on planet velocities at their current
positions and do not take into account later effects from other planets,
thus their paths will vary slightly.

<p>The following keys are active in the solar system window:

<h1>Set time rates window</h1>

<p>Use this window to set the display update interval and the
time speed.

<p>The display update interval is the amount of time <b>Night Vision</b>
waits before updating the display (assuming that time is not paused).  For
example, setting to 2 seconds will update
the display every 2 seconds.  Use longer intervals for slower computers that
take a lot of time to update (or specify less stars to display with the
<a href="setstar.html">Set star parameters</a> window).

<p>The time speed is the rate at which <b>Night Vision</b> advances time
relative to the computer.  Set to "1X" for normal operation.  To watch
time move backward, set to "-1X".  Set to "1440X" to watch a day pass
within a minute.  Note:  Time must not be paused (see the Time pull down
menu) for time to proceed.

<p>Pressing "OK" or "Apply" accepts new values.
<br>Pressing "Cancel" rejects any changes.

<p>Only the update interval is saved when saving user preferences.

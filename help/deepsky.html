<td><b>Planetary nebula</b>:  An expanding shell of gases ejected from
a dying star.  Many of these are round in appearance, resembling a planet,
hence the term planetary nebula.

<tr><td><image src="dn.png">
<td><b>Diffuse nebula</b>:  A cloud of interstellar gas and dust, often
associated with star formation.  This includes <i>emission nebula</i>,
where the gas has been excited to shine from the intense radiation of nearby
stars, and <i>reflective nebula</i>, where the dust reflects the light
from nearby stars, and combinations of the two.  Also included in this
category are <i>supernova remnants</i>, the remains of stars that have
exploded.

<tr><td><image src="dk.png">
<td><b>Dark nebula</b>:  A dark cloud of interstellar gas and dust
that obscures the light from more distant objects, leaving what appears
to be a dark void in space.

<tr><td><image src="gc.png">
<td><b>Globular cluster</b>:  A collection of tightly packed stars
in concentrations from approximately ten thousand to over one million stars.
Globulars are not associated with the disk of the Milky Way but rather
move about in highly eccentric elliptical orbits that take them far outside
the Milky Way.

<tr><td><image src="oc.png">
<td><b>Open cluster</b>:  A collection of stars held together by mutual
gravitation, usually originating from the same gas and dust cloud.  Thus
typically the stars have similar ages.  Unlike globulars they are associated
with the disk of the Milky Way.

<tr><td><image src="ga.png">
<td><b>Galaxy</b>:  A huge agglomeration of stars, clusters, gas, and dust,
such as our own Milky Way galaxy.  There are several types (and subtypes)
including <i>spiral galaxies</i>, <i>elliptical galaxies</i>,
and <i>irregular galaxies</i>.

<tr><td><image src="s2.png">
<td><b>Double star</b>:  Two stars in close proximity to each other
(along our line of sight), usually bound together gravitationally.  Not
usually associated with deep sky objects, this type is listed solely because
